        <h2>VS Code</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Right click folder -> open in Integrated Terminal - opens Terminal in VS Code</li>
          <li>Get in the habit of always killing terminal when done by clicking the trash can icon</li>
          <li>Right click -> preview lets you see your markdown preview</li>
          <li>Double click a tab on the top to make it stay. You can tell it worked when the text goes from italic to normal.</li>

          <h3>Terminal Notes</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>press tab to autocomplete names that you know are present</li>
              <li>When navigating in Terminal, a leading slash on your path makes the path absolute, whereas omitting it makes the path relative to your present working directory. A leading slash means "at the root of the website", whereas omitting the slash means "the URL is relative to my current page".</li>
              <li>Most terminal commands have options — these are modifiers that you add onto the end of a command, which make it behave in a slightly different way.</li>
              <li>To find out exactly what options each command has available, you can look at its man page. This is done by typing the man command, followed by the name of the command you want to look up, for example man ls. Press q to quit when you're done.</li>
              <li>To run a command with multiple options at the same time, you can usually put them all in a single string after the dash character, for example ls -lah, or ls -ltrh.</li>
            </ul><br>

          <h3>Terminal commands</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>pwd - print working directory // this shows what folder you're in</li>
              <li>ls - list // this lists the files in the folder you're in</li>
              <li>cd - change directory // navigate to a different folder using slashes</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: cd users/finnlambouris</li>
              </ul>
              <li>cd .. - navigate backwards // move up a folder</li>
              <li>mkdir - make directory // creates folder</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: mkdir coding-bootcamp</li>
              </ul>
              <li>rmdir — remove directory // removes the named directory, but only if it's empty</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If you want to remove a directory that is not empty (and also remove everything it contains), then you can use the rm -r command. <strong>BUT this is dangerous.</strong> -r (recursive) deletes everything within the directory, so make sure there is nothing you might need later on, as it will be gone <strong>forever</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>rm - remove // rm [filename] deletes a file. This delete is permanent and can't be undone via the recycle bin that you might have on your desktop user interface.</li>
              <li>touch - create file // create a file with any file extension</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>touch [folder/folder/file] - creates a file within a folder without having to cd there</li>
                </ul>
              <li>open - open file or folder // this opens the file or folder in the appropriate application</li>
              <li>cp - copy files or directories // creates a copy of the file in the first location specified, in the second location specified. This is basically just creating a new copy and you're specifying the name. It isn't copying into a new folder.</li>
              <li>mv - move files or directories // Technically the file is being moved, but from a practical perspective, this command is actually renaming the file.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: mv mdn-example.md mdn-example.txt will rename the .md file to a .txt file.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>-h or --help // will give you more information about a specific command</li>
              <li>curl - download files found at specific URLs</li>
              <li>grep - search for fragments of text inside larger bodies of text</li>
              <li>less, cat - view a file's contents page by page</li>
              <li>awk, tr, sed - manipulate and transform streams of text // for example, changing all the instances of &LT;div&GT;s in an HTML file to &LT;article&GT;</li>
            </ul><br>

          <h3>Pulling from and pushing to GitHub</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Never edit files directly in GitHub!</li>
              <li>Make sure you're in the correct folder. If there isn't already a repository set up, enter: git init</li>
              <li>To check what branch we are currently on, enter: git status</li>
              <li>To make a new branch, we'll enter: git checkout -b feature/[enter name]
                <ul class="note">
                  <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch, and the -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
                  <li>It's good to do "feature/" to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>To add/update code to the current working branch, enter: git add -A
                <ul class="note">
                  <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>To commit these files to the repo, enter: git commit -m [enter message]
                <ul class="note">
                  <li>If you forget to add the -m message, it will open up a new window where you must type the message. In this window, press I to enter insert mode and then type your message. When you're done, press esc to exit insert mode, and then press :wq to write and quit.</li></li>
                </ul>
              <li>Always double check to make sure your local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. To do this, enter: git pull origin main</li>
                <ul class="note">
                  <li>Use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. "origin" indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. "main" indicates the branch.</li>
                  <li>If all is well, you should receive the message "Already up to date."</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Finally, to push changes, enter: git push origin feature/[enter name]</li>
              <li>After this, when you open GitHub you'll see that there is a pull request. Great job!</li>
            </ol><br>

          <h3>HTML Notes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
              <li>&LT;a href="[url]"&GT;[link text]&LT;/a&GT; - adding a link</li>
              <li>&LT;img src="[url or path]" alt="[image description]"&GT- adding an image</li>
              <li>&LT;&excl;-- [insert comment] --&GT; - add comments in html file without them showing up on the actual webpage</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The shortcut for this is to press command + / to make the current line into a comment.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Classes and ids are similar, but a class can be used multiple times while an id can only be used once.</li>
              <li>With self closing tags, make sure to do /> instead of >, even though > will still work.</li>
              <li>&LT;div&GT; and &LT;span&GT; are generic tags with no meaning (not semantic)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Semantic HTML is better for code legibility, accessibility features like screen readers, and SEO. If you're using a generic tag, there is probably a semantic tag that would work better.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>head<strong>er</strong> vs head<strong>ing</strong> - header is at the top of the page, heading is &LT;h1&GT; through &LT;h6&GT;</li>

              <li>to link an external stylesheet to your HTML file, you must type &LT;link rel="Stylesheet" href=[insert path to Stylesheet]&GT;</li>
              <li>You can apply multiple classes to HTML; just separate them by a space.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: class="class-1 class-2"</li>
              </ul>
              <li>The font-family values go from most specific to least specific. This means that if the first font cannot be accessed by the device, it will move onto the next value. 
                <ul>
                  <li>Example: font-family: "Comic Sans" cursive sans-serif</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Setting the height and line height as the same number is a cheat code to center text vertically.</li>

          <h3>Selectors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>From least to most specific:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Universal - selects all HTML elements on the page</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: * {</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Element - selects HTML elements based on the element name</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: p {</li>
                    <li>You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a style rule</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Example: p.class would only affect paragraphs with the “class” class</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                <li>Class - selects HTML elements based on (one of) their class(es)</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: .class {</li>

                <li>ID - selects HTML elements based on the unique id</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: #unique-id {</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              <li>Any of these types of selectors can be given a further pseudo-class, which is used to define a special state of an element</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: .class:hover {</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The rule with more specificity is the one that will win if there are conflicting style rules</li>
            <li>Style rules can be grouped</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: h1, h2, p {</li>
              </ul>
            </ul><br>

          <h3>Display</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Inline elements</strong> do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.</li>

                  <li>You cannot set the width and height of inline elements - except for images</li>
                </ul>
              <li><strong>Block elements</strong> always start on a new line and take up the full width available.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>margin: 0 auto can be used for block elements to set the top and bottom margins to 0 and center it horizontally within its parent element.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Each element has a default display, but it can be changed with CSS by adding the “display” property.</li>
              <li>Elements can be hidden by using the display:none declaration.</li>
            </ul><br>

          <h3>Box Model</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>From innermost to outermost: content -> padding -> border -> margin</li>
              <li><strong>Content</strong> - the content's “hitbox”</li>
              <li><strong>Padding</strong> - the space between the border and content</li>
              <li><strong>Border</strong> - the border! Duh!</li>
              <li><strong>Margin</strong> - the spacing between elements</li>
              <li>The overall “size” of the image is only the content + padding + border, because the margin isn't a part of any element, it's just the spacing between them.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Example: 200px x 200px image with 20px padding, 10px border, and 30px of padding will have a width and height of 260px (200 + (20x2) + (10x2).</li>
                </ul>
              <li>The border-style needs to be set to have your border appear on the page.</li>
            </ul><br>

          <h3>Positioning</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Types of positioning:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Static</strong> - this is the default value and the element is in normal document flow</li>
                  <li><strong>Relative</strong> - the element is still in normal flow, but the values top, right, left and bottom can be used to offset the element.</li>
                  <li><strong>Absolute</strong> - The element is removed from the normal flow and its final position is relative to the determined parent or ancestor. To determine the parent, you must give it the position: absolute; declaration as well. Absolute-positioned elements are also moved by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fixed</strong> - The element is removed from the normal document flow and the position is relative to the viewport. Fixed-position elements are also determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Viewport: the area of the window in which web content can be seen</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
              <li>Note: normal flow means that the HTML will display in the order it is written. If a static or relative positioned &LT;img&GT; is written inside of a &LT;section&GT;, it will appear there on the page.</li>
              <li>Z-index controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a page. An element with a higher z-index value will appear in front of an element with a lower z-index value.</li>
            </ul><br>
